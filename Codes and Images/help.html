●	Why does your web site contain advertisements?<br><br>
<br><br>In order to keep Read&Watch a free service, we need to use advertisers to cover the cost of operating the best weather site on the web. We understand your concerns and will forward them to our internet department. 
●	Why did you choose the current new site layout?<br><br>
<br><br>We've worked hard to find the best balance of advertising and content, and it was our intention to separate content and advertising more completely with the new site. This results in a column for content (left side) and the column for advertising (right side). It's our hope that by pulling the advertising out of the content we've created a better experience for people scanning quickly for the book and movies.
●	Why do you have so many pop-up ads?<br><br>
<br><br>In order to keep Read&Watch a free service, we need to use advertisers to cover the cost of operating the best weather site on the web. We understand your concerns about the rate of pop-under ads, and recently, we have taken steps to reduce the number of pop-under ads that appear, and a user should not get more than 2 in a particular 5 minute session. This rate of pop-under ads is similar to many other major sites on the Internet. 
●	What can I do if I see an ad that I think is indecent?<br><br>
<br><br>Read&Watch would like to assure you that in no way, shape or form do we promote or accept spyware, adware, or any indecent advertisements from our sponsors or advertisers.At your earliest convenience, please send a screen capture of the intrusive advertisement you are referring to (including the URL) by sending an e-mail. Read&Watch, Inc., is a family oriented business with strong ethics who would not knowingly place this kind of material on our user's computers.
●	Does Read&Watch sell their client database to third parties?<br><br>
<br><br>Please be assured that Read&Watch, Inc. does not sell any user's personal information to another company under any circumstances. If you sign up for one of readandwatch.com pay services, such as Premium or Professional, or for free products, such as Read&Watch.com Desktop or Alert, your personal information is kept strictly confidential and only used for internal purposes that enable Read&Watch, Inc to serve you better.
